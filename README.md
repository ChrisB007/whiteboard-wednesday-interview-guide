# Whiteboard Wednesday - Interview Guide

## Basic Structure Of The Activity

- You're split into two groups, A and B.
- A has been given one problem, B another.
- Each group will spend some time going over this here document, as well as an interview guide for the problem they were already given and (presumably) did. The guide has advice for helping someone else with the problem, as well as several solutions.
- Then, each member of Group A will interview someone from B on problem **A**, which the interviewer from A has already completed (and now has a guide for).
- Following that, the pair will flip, and the person from B will interview their partner from A on problem **B**, with their own solution and guide in hand.

## What Are We Testing For, Here?

Remember, the interviewee is being tested on their ability to talk through their through process, humbly ask for guidance if needed, get themselves unstuck, and keep a cool head when problem-solving.

## What Are We Definitely Not Testing For, Here?

- Whether someone can successfully solve the problem.
- Whether their syntax is correct.

## Incredibly Useful Advice

### Interviewees

- Talk through the problem - it's about the process, not the solution!
- Don't give up. Ask questions!
- Solve the problem, don't build the app.
  - Don't sweat syntax.
  - Pseudocode.
  - Invent helper functions that don't yet exist.
- Ask about edge cases.

### Interviewers

- Encourage them to follow the advice above!
- Think about how YOU solved the problem.
- Remember that syntax does NOT matter--they don't have to have a running program! YOU will know when it works or doesn't.
- Don't solve the problem for them.
- But DO get them unstuck.
- Give them hints via, "What if you did this?"
- Give them twists via, "What if you had this input?" or "What if we needed this to happen too?"
- Remember that this is an amazing learning experience for YOU, as a teacher, as someone who needs to understand the problem enough to help someone though it.
